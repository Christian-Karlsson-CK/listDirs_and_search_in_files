In Germanic folklore, including Germanic mythology, a dwarf
is an entity that dwells in the mountains and in the earth.
The entity is associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and
crafting. Dwarfs are sometimes described as short and ugly.
However, some scholars have questioned whether this is a
later development stemming from comical portrayals of the
beings.[1] Dwarfs continue to be depicted in modern popular
culture in various media.
