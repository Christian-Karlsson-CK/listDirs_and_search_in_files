An elf (pl.Â elves) is a type of humanoid supernatural
being in Germanic mythology and folklore (especially
North Germanic mythology and folklore). In medieval
Germanic-speaking cultures, elves generally seem to
have been thought of as beings with magical powers and
supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people
and capable of either helping or hindering them.[1]
However, the details of these beliefs have varied
considerably over time and space and have flourished in
both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.
